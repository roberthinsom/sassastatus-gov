                <li><strong>Reference Number:</strong> If you have applied for a grant, you would have received a reference number which is essential for checking your status.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Details:</strong> Basic personal information like full names and date of birth may also be required.</li>

                <li><strong>Navigate to the Status Check Section:</strong> Look for the “Check your status” link, often found under the ‘Grants’ or ‘Services’ tab.</li>
